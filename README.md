Our project is a C++ program that stores data into graph data structure, and
does many types of operations. The program reads txt file, or user input,
and stores data into graph. User can assign districts, calculate shortest 
distance or path with limited distances between two vertices, display graph 
and informationabout specific vertex or edge. The progam also has a snakes
and ladders game inside.
